Un-Truncated_Trajectories.pdf gives AMCEM trajectories from an analysis of the read data with raw importance weights (i.e. normalized, but not truncated). Two runs were performed on each of 27 different parameter combinations. 

See scr/Data/ for detailed information on the final parameter estimate from each trajectory.
